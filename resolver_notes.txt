Dependency Resolver

Process-deps:
Check for next package
    If exists, run Check-installed
    If not, remove from depth-list and go up one level to process deps

Check-installed:
Check depth-list for package
    if found, add full depth-list to circular-deps list
    if not, continue
Check installed programs for package
    if found, checks version is >=
        if so, go back to process-deps
        if not, continue
    if not found, continue
Check current install list for package
    if found, check if version is >=
        if so, go back to process-deps
        if not, go to Script-find
    if not found, go to Script-find

Script-find:
Check scripts for
package
    if found, check if version is ==
        if so, add to install list, go to deps-list
        if not, checks if version is >=
            if at least one exists, take the highest, add to install list, go to deps-list
            if not, continue
    if not found, add to missing-deps list; Go back to Process-deps (break/return)

Deps-list:
Checks deps-lists for package-version
    if so, add name to depth-list, goto process-deps of said deps-list
    if not, add to missing-deps-list list, go back to Process-deps (break/return)
