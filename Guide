BLFS and custom Linux -- Guide

After LFS process has been completed and successfully rebooted...

Make sure the root drive is backed up!
    This is especially useful so that the system can be experimented
    with and reset to a fresh start without having to rebuild the basic
    system from scratch again.

Run lists to add various functionalities to the system. See the instructions
included in the comments of each list for any specific info. This will consist
of the following:

list-START
    About: This sets up very basic necessities - a user account, wget, sudo, ssl,
    mouse support in the console, a simple text-based web-browser, and various
    other basic configurations and necessities.
    Vital Prep: Disable tests for wget! Reenable them and reinstall after
    installing gnutls later on, IF gnutls is installed. Not sure if this
    second run will be any better.... remains to be seen.
    Notes: in bashfiles it may be desired to change or add user accounts.
        Files are copied from files/etc and files/home to their respective
        places; these may be modified as desired either before or after
        bashfiles has been run.
        After running sudo, su to root and modify the visudo file so that
        sudo can be used. Without this step, as_root as well as sudo, used in
        many subsequent scripts will fail!
        copy_agent is a non-blfs installation and may need to be modifed if
        the host changes the links or other details of the package.
        Aside from the post-sudo manual steps, this list should proceed from
        start to finish automatically, without difficulty.
    In progress: I recently modified bashfiles to copy the config files already
        made, rather than creating them inline (here-docs). Confirm these
        changes by removing this note after successful run.

Security:
list-SECSERV
list-SECHIGH
list-SECMED
list-SECLOW
    About: These are varied levels of security (obviously). Each has everything
        included in the lower levels plus additional packages. SECLOW is ideal for
        basic security where the rest of the system is either not known or the
        packages and dependencies are well worked out in other lists. SECMED is a
        nice balance between good security, coverage of common dependencies, and
        yet not overly large. SECHIGH has all security packages covered in BLFS,
        plus many more common dependencies. Finally, SECSERV has everything in
        SECHIGH, plus openldap and krb5.
    Attention: shadow (all lists) requires a quick su, enter password, exit. su
        is executed at the end of the first script, so you will have to enter
        the password and exit, then proceed to the config script and onward.
        postfix has a couple of commands to run manually afterward to test it.
    In progress: stunnel has a line that supposedly tells stunnel to take
        the default (localhost) server IP. I think this works...?

preX:
    Just a few more useful packages that satisfy dependencies for Xorg
